India 🇮🇳 | We are often being told that "The Youth are the future pillars of the nation. " But,  I am afraid that the same youth are not given adequate opportunities to uplift their standard of lives. Take the case of engineering alone. Most of the graduates are working in those sectors completely different from the field of engineering. This actually raises concerns on our education sector. The rote learning system also needs to shift gears and focus more on intensive research and in turn provide funding to these students right from the final year of the Bachelors.This might help students to pursue the subject in detail. Also, a large scale of unemployment can also be reduced, if we could implement it in the diploma  streams as well. Colleges should provide research facilities too.

Netizen | I think we have the system in place in Akshyas and CSC we seek most of local body documentations from there, apps like ksmart just need to incorporate such a rating system additionally. These things could reduce corrupt practices. Great thought from your end go forward with this, pitch such ideas through startup mission and you could get this realized | Thanks for the information and i appreciate your concern. Sometimes a small change is all it takes to create a positive outcome.
