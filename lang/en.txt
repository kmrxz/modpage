p2=Whenever a government service is delivered, the person receiving the service will provide a rating based on service quality, behavior, and awareness.
p3=Good service results in good ratings. Poor service results in bad ratings with mandatory evidence submission. All data must remain 100 percent confidential.
p4=A trusted and independent team will verify, manage, and audit all submitted data to prevent misuse.
